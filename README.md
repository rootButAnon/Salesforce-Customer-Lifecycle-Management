# Salesforce-Customer-Lifecycle-Management
This is an implementation guide on how to create a Customer Lifecycle Management (CLM) system in Salesforce from scratch.

Since I am not experienced in determining the types of implementations a real business might require, I used ChatGPT to help me create a business model and provide a task guide on what should be developed and configured to meet all business requirements.

You can refer to the ClientDoc.pdf for the conversation I had with ChatGPT to generate the business model. Once the development is complete, an additional document, ImplementationDoc.pdf, will explain all the implementations made in the organization.
